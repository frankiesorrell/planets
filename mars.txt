Cold and dry on Mars, but everything is my favourite colour. 
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman. 
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity.
Seems like a lot of problems, let's look at Venus instead...
Maybe we should consider going to Jupiter instead. 
It's getting cold...

I don't like the look of that cyclone!
